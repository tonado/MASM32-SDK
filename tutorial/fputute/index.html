<P><BR><B><A NAME="intro"> INTRODUCTION</A></B>
<P>The FPU, also known as a co-processor, used to be an option when the first PCs came
on the market. Modern PCs are now all provided with a co-processor. Although the
original PC-XT has evolved considerably over the years, the FPU itself has not changed
appreciably during that same period. Apart from a few minor instructions having been
added, the main improvement has been the extended range of some of the existing
instructions.
<P>The entire set of assembler instructions for the FPU is relatively small and could be
memorized rapidly. Learning which parameter(s) can be used with each instruction
should take only slightly longer. The main difficulty is in developing sound programming
techniques to avoid some of the pitfalls peculiar to the FPU.
<P>The main purpose of this document is to show that using the FPU can be relatively easy
with minimal effort. Once the basics have been mastered, any computation however
complex can be performed.
<P>The first chapter describes the internals of the FPU and how they function. Some of this
knowledge is an absolute necessity to use the FPU properly or help later in
understanding the outcome of some of the instructions. This is followed by a chapter
describing the various data types which can be used with some of the instructions,
including a detailed review of the floating point data formats.
<P>The FPU instructions are then discussed in detail in the following chapters which
regroup them according to some "biased" criteria. Although some description of each
instruction is available in the Fphelp.hlp file provided with MASM32, a more in-depth
review is provided with more tangible examples of their usage.
<P>The final chapter provides a fully commented example of a semi-complex computation.
<P>It should be noted that this document has been prepared according to the syntax used
by MASM. Although most other assemblers/compilers should have a similar syntax for
the FPU instruction mnemonics, their syntax may differ for the addressing mode of
memory variables. It is also known that some of the instructions used without explicit
parameters are not supported by some of the other assemblers/compilers.
<P>Any comment or suggestion aimed at improving this document will be given due
consideration. Those can be sent to:
